                <p id="autobio">Hello there! My name is Eric Nunn. I am a Front-End Web Developer and current Owner/Founder of Lowly Hero Web Development & Technology, Co. I specialize in creating mobile-responsive, <em>user-friendly</em> websites using technologies such as:</p>
                <ul class="tech">
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>CSS/Sass</li>
                    <li>Bootstrap</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>jQuery</li>
                    <li>Node.js and npm</li>
                    <li>Git/Git Bash</li>
                    <li>Gulp</li>
                    <li>Chrome DevTools</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I love taking things apart and putting them back together again in order to figure out what makes things work! This passion for understanding how the world works "underneath the hood" eventually led me to explore how and why our world was being rapidly dominated by these little boxes located in homes across the world. This spark of <i class="text-secondary">curiosity</i> turned into an obsession with computer programming. I quickly realized that to be able to communicate with a computer was to wield a tremendous power. The first time I went on Codecademy and made "Hello World!" show up in a browser, I was hooked. My keyboard suddenly became my wand, and my computer became my book of spells. Now roughly 2 years after that first "Hello World" showed up on my screen, my goal is to find a Front-End Developer role with a company that shares my passion for creating beautiful, functional user-experiences.</p>

                <p>When I am not in front of a computer screen, I am probably spending time with my wife and 2-year old son, gaming on my PS4 (Spider-Man or Borderlands anyone?!) , playing the guitar, or reading.</p>

                <blockquote cite="https://fs.blog/2013/11/richard-feynman-curiosity/">"It has to do with <i class="text-secondary">curiosity</i>. It has to do with people wondering what makes something do something. And then to discover, if you try to get answers, that they are related to each other â€“ that things that make the wind make the waves, that the motion of water is like the motion of air is like the motion of sand. The fact that things have common features. It turns out more and more universal. What we are looking for is how everything works. What makes everything work."
